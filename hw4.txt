* HW
1) thread create, exit, join implemented in thread
2) Thread spinlock is implemented thread and thread mutex is implemented in thread_m

*Extra credits:
1) Conditional Variables implemented in UPROG = thread_c
2) Semaphores = Not implemented
3) Fix sbrk and malloc = Implemented in thread_malloc and thread_sbrk
4) per thread variables: I have implemented this in thread_localvars.c
but because of the limitation of the number of user programs I have
not added '_thread_localvars' in UPROGS.
To test this please execute thread_cutemacros
5) cute macros: thread_cutemacros user program created
